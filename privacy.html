    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: September 19, 2025</p>

  <div class="container">
    <p><strong>This site is the official website of SoruvaLab, the developer of the Finqly app.</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains how SoruvaLab (“we,” “us,” or “our”) handles information in connection with the Finqly app (“App”). Finqly is designed to work without accounts, sign-ins, or any personal data collection.</p>

    <h2>1. No Personal Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII). The App is fully functional without login or registration.</p>

    <h2>2. Local-Only Storage</h2>
    <p>All data—such as diagnosis results and emotional history—is stored only on your device (e.g., local storage/SharedPreferences). We do not operate servers to receive or back up this data.</p>

    <h2>3. In-App Purchases (Google Play Billing)</h2>
    <p>Payments are processed securely by Google Play. We do not receive your payment card details. The App may receive a purchase token from Google Play to unlock premium features; this token remains on-device and is not linked to your identity.</p>

    <h2>4. No Third-Party Analytics or Ads</h2>
    <p>Finqly does not use third-party analytics SDKs, advertising SDKs, cookies, or tracking tools.</p>

    <h2>5. External Links</h2>
    <p>When you open external links (e.g., help forms or legal pages), they are opened in your browser and governed by the destination site’s privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>Because all Finqly data is stored locally, uninstalling the App removes the stored data. You can also clear the App’s storage from your device settings. If you wish to contact us about deletion or other privacy requests, you can use our
      <a href="https://forms.gle/Vr6G6p1ngcVC1Niz6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Form</a> or email us.</p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided information to us, please contact us and we will address it promptly.</p>

    <h2>8. International Users</h2>
    <p>We aim to respect privacy expectations in applicable jurisdictions (e.g., GDPR/CCPA). Since the App does not collect or transmit personal data, rights such as access or erasure generally do not apply; however, you may still contact us with any questions or requests.</p>

    <h2>9. Future AI Enhancements</h2>
    <p>Currently, Finqly does not use AI models. If in the future AI or server-based features are introduced, this Policy will be updated and users will be notified within the App or through our legal site before such changes take effect.</p>

    <h2>10. Updates to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. Please check this page periodically for changes.</p>

    <h2>11. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Finqly name, logo, and related assets are the intellectual property of SoruvaLab. Unauthorized use is prohibited. While trademarks may not be officially registered at this time, we assert prior-use rights under applicable law.</p>

    <h2>12. Prohibited Use & Responsibility</h2>
    <p>Finqly is provided for personal, non-commercial use only. You may not use the App’s insights or interface for commercial purposes, data mining, or reverse engineering. Use of the App is at your own discretion and risk, and SoruvaLab shall not be held responsible for outcomes resulting from its use.</p>

    <h2>13. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Policy, contact us at
