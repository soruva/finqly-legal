    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <div class="container">
    <p><strong>This site is the official website of SoruvaLab, the developer of the Finqly app.</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains how SoruvaLab (“we,” “us,” or “our”) handles information in connection with the Finqly app (“App”). Finqly is designed to work without accounts, sign-ins, or any personal data collection.</p>

    <h2>1. No Personal Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII). The App is fully functional without login or registration.</p>

    <h2>2. Local-Only Storage</h2>
    <p>All data—such as analysis results and emotional history—is stored only on your device (e.g., local storage/SharedPreferences). We do not operate servers to receive or back up this data.</p>

    <h2>3. In-App Purchases (Google Play Billing)</h2>
    <p>Payments are processed securely by Google Play. We do not receive your payment card details. The App may receive a purchase token from Google Play to unlock premium features; this token remains on-device and is not linked to your identity.</p>

    <h2>4. No Third-Party Analytics or Ads</h2>
    <p>Finqly does not use third-party analytics SDKs, advertising SDKs, cookies, or tracking tools.</p>

    <h2>5. External Links</h2>
    <p>When you open external links (e.g., help forms or legal pages), they are opened in your browser and governed by the destination site’s privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>Because all Finqly data is stored locally, uninstalling the App removes the stored data. You can also clear the App’s storage from your device settings. If you wish to contact us about deletion or other privacy requests, you can use our
      <a href="https://forms.gle/Vr6G6p1ngcVC1Niz6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Form</a> or email us.</p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided information to us, please contact us and we will address it promptly.</p>

    <h2>8. International Users</h2>
    <p>We aim to respect privacy expectations in applicable jurisdictions (e.g., GDPR/CCPA). Since the App does not collect or transmit personal data, rights such as access or erasure generally do not apply; however, you may still contact us with any questions or requests.</p>

    <h2>9. Future AI Enhancements</h2>
    <p>Currently, Finqly does not use AI models. If in the future AI or server-based features are introduced, they will be designed to minimize data use (e.g., using anonymized or non-identifiable text). Free-tier APIs may be used initially; if any change affects users (such as sending data to external providers), users will be notified in advance within the App or via this Legal Center.</p>

    <h2>10. User Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction (e.g., GDPR in the EU, CCPA in California), you may have the right to request access, correction, deletion, or restriction of your data. Since Finqly stores all data locally, these rights are generally exercised by uninstalling or resetting the App. If you have concerns, you may still contact us at <a href="mailto:support@soruvalab.com">support@soruvalab.com</a> or via our <a href="https://forms.gle/Vr6G6p1ngcVC1Niz6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Form</a>.</p>

    <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, SoruvaLab shall not be held responsible for any direct, indirect, or incidental damages resulting from the use or inability to use the App, including but not limited to data loss or device issues.</p>

    <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Japan. Any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Tokyo, Japan.</p>

    <h2>13. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Policy, contact us at
      <a href="mailto:support@soruvalab.com">support@soruvalab.com</a>.
